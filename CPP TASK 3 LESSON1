/* Problem 3
Write a program which reads from the user three non-negative integers and then
prints, using symbols ’*’, a ‘histogram’ of the data represented by the numbers, i.e.,
three vertical bars, aligned at the bottom, with heights equal to the values of the
three numbers.
For example, the execution of the program could look like this:
$ ./histo
Enter three non-negative numbers: 3 1 8
*
*
*
*
*
* *
* *
***
$
Do not use arrays, strings or any other kind of collections.*/
