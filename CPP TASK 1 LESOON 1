/*Problem 1
Write a program which asks the user to enter his/her height (in meters, as double)
and the weight (in kilograms, also as a double). Then the program should print
his/her BMI coefficient (body mass index ) defined as the weight in kilograms divided
by the square of height in meters â€” this number should come out close to 20.*/
//int add2(int i);

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
	{
		double height ,weight,bmi;
		cout << "Enter a value for weight in kg " << endl;

		cin >> weight;
		cout << "Enter a value for height in meter " << endl;
		cin >> height;

		bmi = (weight) / (height*height);
		cout << "Your bmi is: " << endl;

		cout << bmi << endl;
			system("pause");
